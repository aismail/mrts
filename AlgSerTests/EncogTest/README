Using ENCOG to run some tests on different ANN algorithms

Packages:
- Demo1: testing Backpropagation algorithms' time performance on ECG dataset
	(the same dataset used in Demo4 from BackpropSp)
	link: http://biomed.uninet.edu/2010/n3/ayub.html
		- Simple backpropagation (from 5min to 15m training, 
		depends on the precision we set)
		- Resilient backpropagation (less than 5min)
		- LMA (..doesn't work, it freezes)
