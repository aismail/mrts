Implementing ANN Backpropagation algorithm

# Author: G.S. Cole (gsc@digiburo.com)

JavaDoc: http://backprop1.sourceforge.net/doc/javadoc/com/digiburo/backprop1/package-summary.html
SourcesAvailableAt: http://sourceforge.net/projects/backprop1

Description:

"backprop1" provides support for a simple three layer backpropagation neural network implemented in Java.

"backprop1" is hosted on Source Forge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/backprop1

I have created some small demonstration programs to validate backprop1. There are demonstrations of point classification (demo1), the XOR problem (demo2) and character recognition (demo3). You might find these useful examples of how backprop1 might be used.

"backprop1" is free for your use. There is no cost, no warranty, no support, nothing but good wishes and java sources. If you do something really neat please send an email about your success. Good luck with your project. 

Build:
1) Edit build.properties (change base.dir to reflect the proper path).
2) ant compile
3) (optional) ant javadoc

Usage:
- GenerateDatum -> generates data for training [output: demoX.trn]
- Trainer -> trains the network and saves it - serialized [ouput: demoX.serial]
- Tester -> tests the network on data 

Packages inside the project:
demo1 - point classification (below/above a line)
demo2 - XOR problem
demo3 - character recognition
demo4 - ECG anomalies detection (Arrythmia detection)
	- following the article from http://biomed.uninet.edu/2010/n3/ayub.html
		- ECG dataset: sensor.stream.csv
		- ECG annotations set: ann.stream.csv
		- ECG test set: test.stream.csv
		- 3 trained BP feedfwd-networks: 
			demo4_1.serial (4min), 
			demo4_2.serial (1h15min),
			demo4_3.serial (2h19min),
			=> ~1h30m 
		- tests results -> in beats.txt (1 for Normal beat, -1 for Ventricular beat)
network - BP feedfwd-netw implementation using the graph model (not matrix model)

TODO Required:
1: demo4 - demo on a dataset similar with what we will going to test [DONE]
