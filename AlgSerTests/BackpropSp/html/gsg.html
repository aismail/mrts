Hello and thanks for reviewing <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/backprop1">backprop1</a>.

<p>
"backprop1" provides support for a simple three layer backpropagation neural network implemented in Java. 

<p>
Please note there are two versions of backprop1.  The older version resides
in CVS and builds to "backprop1" - and a newer version is within SVN and
builds "backprop1b".  The two versions are nearly identical, but I hope 
you will adopt the SVN version ("backprop1b").

<p>
If you are an eclipse user, you can pull the sources into a workspace by
using SVN.

<p>
Otherwise, it might be easier to download "backprop1b_src.jar" which will
contain everything you need.  There will be a ant build.xml inside the jar 
to help you build the application.

<p>
The backprop1 distribution comes with backpropagation network code and 
three demo applications, a point classifier (demo1), a XOR example (demo2) 
and a digit recognition application (demo3).  Each demo application has a
dedicated help page in the html directory.

<p>
To get started, edit "build.properties" to reflect the path to backprop1b.
Type "ant compile" - and you should be done.  ("ant javadoc" is optional
but a good idea).

<p>
It is necessary to train a network before using a demo.  It isn't difficult
and I have provided applications to perform training for you.  See the 
JavaDoc.

<p>
Everybody likes "demo3" the first time because it has a GUI. 

<p>
"backprop1" is free for your use. There is no cost, no warranty, no support,
nothing but good wishes and java sources. If you do something really neat 
please send an <A HREF="mailto:guycole@gmail.com">email</A> about your 
success. Good luck with your project.
