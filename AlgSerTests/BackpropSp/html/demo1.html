<HR>

This demonstration classifies points as above or below the line y = -5x+2.
The network has 2 input nodes, 7 middle nodes, one output node.  Sources
are found in com.digiburo.backprop1b.demo1

<P>
The input nodes contain the (X, Y) coordinates of the point.
Note that inputs must be scaled in the range (0, 1) so the
training set will only contain points in this range.

<P>
Output nodes return values in the range of (0, 1), so a positive 
point will have a value near 1.0 and a negative point would be 
near 0.0

<P>
To recreate the demo:

<OL>
<LI>Obtain backprop1b.jar (download or build).  
    Update $CLASSPATH to include jar file.
    Package name is com.digiburo.backprop1b.demo1 so ensure you type the
    correct command (i.e. java com.digiburo.backprop1b.demo1.GenerateDatum
    to generate datum).
<LI>Run the GenerateDatum utility to generate a training set of 
    250 random points along with the corrsponding output value.  
    These random points are saved as a serialized PatternList 
    in a file named 'demo1.trn'. Here is a graph containing a 
    <A HREF="./demo1_train.png"> Sample Demo1 Training Set</A>
<LI>The Trainer utility accepts the training file 'demo1.trn' and 
    produces 'demo1.serial' after the network has been trained.  
    'demo1.serial' contains a serialized Network class.
    Note that training can take some time, and might not ever finish.
    If training takes an excessive amount of time (say, overnight)
    then I kill Trainer and restart.  

<PRE>
Trainer runtime produces output like this:
14520000 success:247 needed:250 best run:247
89 128 129 
</PRE>

    Read first line as: cumulative training cycle total, patterns trained, 
    total patterns, most patterns successfully trained this report.
    The second line contains the indices of untrained patterns.  
    It is useful to know which patterns are inhibiting training, so the
    the training set can be modified.

    <P>
    In this case, there have been 14520000 cycles through the training set.
    Right now, 247 out of 250 patterns have been trained.  Best run this
    cycle was 247 matched patterns.  Patterns 89, 128, 129 still fail
    training.  (It will be typical to have a few problem patterns like this).

<LI>The Tester utility generates points over the range of [0, 1] 
    at increments of 0.1 and submits each point to the trained
    Network for classification.  Here is a graph containing a 
    <A HREF="./demo1_test.png"> Sample Demo1 Test Set</A>
</OL>

<P>
As you can see from the graph
<A HREF="./demo1_test.png"> Sample Demo1 Test Set</A>
the network has imperfectly learned the line.  
It's a good generalization, especially given that the training
set was randomly generated.
If you don't like the results, you could always generate another
random training set and try again.  
Another improvement might be to have more points along the line,
especially at the endpoints.
