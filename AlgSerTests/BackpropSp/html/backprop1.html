<HR>

The core package is com.digiburo.backprop1 and here is a UML 
<A HREF="./bp1_class.gif">class diagram</A>.  Many of my comments
are tied to this diagram, so you might want to print it for reference.

<P>
A neural network consists of arcs and nodes and my design
reflects this basic structure.

<P>
ArcNodeParent is shared by arcs and nodes.  It only contains a unique ID.
Yes, I know about Object.hashCode().  I wanted small, sequential numbers
to verify the connections during debugging and Object.hashCode() gives
large numbers which are not (reliably) sequential.

<P>
Arcs connect Nodes.  In keeping w/the usual backpropagation design
arcs contain weight terms which are applied to the connecting nodes.
There is only one arc class.

<P>
Nodes are connected by arcs and contain error and value terms.  A node
might have many inputs and many outputs.  In contrast to arcs, there
are specific classes for Input, Output and Middle nodes.  AbstractNode
is the base node class.

<P>
InputNode contains the input pattern (i.e. the pattern to be classified).
Note that input values must be scaled in the range (0, 1).  At one time,
I did explicitly test for valid ranges and throw exceptions at offenders.
Currently, the test is commented out for speed.  You might
consider restoring this test if your input set is not well behaved.

<P>
OutputNode contains the output pattern (i.e. results after running the
network).  Outputs are also in the range (0, 1).  The transfer function
is the usual 1/1+e^-arg.

<P>
MiddleNode contains the opaque inner layer.  The only difference between
MiddleNode and OutputNode is a different computeError() method.

<P>
The Network class serializes the state of the arcs and nodes (memento pattern).
This permits a trained class to be written as a file, and later
restored.  If you are new to java, please read the java documentation 
about serialized classes, especially regarding versions.  Some data
sets take a long time to train and it would be annoying to orphan
this work by a serialized object incompatability.  (There are ways
to mitigate this, read the javadoc).

<P>
The BackProp object ties together Network (arcs/nodes) and adds the
NN functionality (i.e. runNetwork() to classify a pattern and 
trainNetwork() to train for a pattern).  BackProp is what your 
application should start from.

<P>
Pattern/PatternList classes are how you specify an training pattern or
a collection of training patterns.  You have a choice of overloaded
methods in BackProp which allow you to load inputs/read results as
an array of double or as a Pattern.  

<P>
Look over the demonstration programs for some implementation hints.  
Each demonstration is implemented as a separate package.  Within
the demo package will be a local class which extends from BackProp.
This adds some local functionality.  There will also be utilities
which generate test datum and perform training.  Finally there will
be an application to exercise the trained network, so you can 
verify the results.
